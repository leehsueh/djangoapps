Why did God send a distressing spirit upon Saul?	"Perhaps to bring him together with David. By bringing David to Saul, God may have wanted Saul to remember what he was like before he became king; humble, meek, and ""the least of his family,"" like David.

When the spirit of God departed from Saul, a consequence of this was allowing the spirit from Satan to enter, since God's protection was removed."	X	1 Samuel 16:14	1 Samuel 16:21-23
